Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, designed to build web applications and APIs efficiently. It's widely used due to its simplicity and ease of integration with various modules, making it a popular choice among developers.

Here are some key reasons why Express.js is used:

Ease of Learning and Use: Express.js is straightforward to pick up, especially for developers familiar with JavaScript. Its simple syntax allows for quick setup and development of web servers and APIs​ (The Web Developer Guide)​.

Flexibility and Minimalism: Express.js is an unopinionated framework, meaning it doesn't enforce any specific project structure or dependencies, allowing developers to choose the best tools and approaches for their specific needs​ (Codecademy)​​ (The Web Developer Guide)​.

Middleware Support: Express.js uses middleware extensively, which allows developers to handle requests and responses efficiently, adding functionalities like authentication, logging, and error handling in a modular way​ (Codecademy)​.

Robust Routing System: It provides a powerful routing system to define URL patterns and HTTP methods, making it easier to manage different routes and actions in the application​ (The Web Developer Guide)​​ (Wikipedia)​.

Integration with MEAN and MERN Stacks: Express.js is a core component of popular full-stack development stacks like MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), making it integral for developing full-stack JavaScript applications​ (The Web Developer Guide)​.

Community and Support: Express.js has a large and active community that contributes to its continuous development, offering extensive documentation, tutorials, and third-party modules​ (The Web Developer Guide)​.

Express.js simplifies the development process by handling common web server tasks, allowing developers to focus on building their applications. This makes it a go-to framework for both small projects and scalable enterprise applications.
