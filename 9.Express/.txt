middleware in Express.Js
middle of the request and response....
Middleware in Express.js are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as modifying the request and response objects, terminating the request-response cycle, calling the next middleware function in the stack, or ending the request-response cycle by sending a response to the client.

Middleware functions are used to:

Execute code before handling a request.
Modify incoming request data.
Perform authentication and authorization checks.
Handle errors.
Execute code after handling a request.
