 A controller is a module or function responsible for handling a specific set of routes for your web application. It acts as an intermediary between the routes (defined in your application's routes file) and the business logic or data access layer.

Controllers help in keeping your code organized and separating concerns. They typically receive requests, process them by invoking the necessary business logic or data access functions, and then send back a response to the client.

For example, in a simple Express.js application, you might have a controller for handling user-related functionality like user registration, login, profile management, etc. Each of these functionalities would have its own controller file, containing functions to handle the corresponding routes.
